**The woocommerce specific conditions are only available if WooCommerce is installed and activated.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum PHP version: 7.4

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum Elementor version: 3.17.0

> [!CAUTION]
> You also need Elementor & Pro for the plugin to work properly

These conditions are only add-ons, they are used in the same way as the default conditions. So you can access the new ones in the same way as the Theme Builder conditions.

There are currently no plans for further expansion, but this may change as user demand changes. Please use the Issue section for this!
